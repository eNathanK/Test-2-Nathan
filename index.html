        <p class="p1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting to workout is a huge fear among many different people for many different reasons. Whether it is because you’re insecure, embarrassed, scared of other people, so on and so forth you have to overcome those fears. The gym community is made up of incredible people and you just have to give it a try!

        <p class="p2">Another problem that starters may have is not knowing how to begin. You need a workout routine that you have to consistently stick to. Your workout routine should reflect your lifestyle, if you have a lot of free time you may want to go to the gym more days a week, but if you’re someone who does not have that kind of time you may want to adjust. However, no matter what kind of schedule you have, being consistent is the key to making real progress</p>
